The application will have 3 different buttons:
1) “+” this button will create a new fragment with max page the number +1
For example, clicking on "+" on page 1 will create a page with the number 2. clicking again will
create a page with the number 3 and so on.
2) “Create new notification” - clicking on this button will create a notification with the text "notification and the
number of pages".
For example, if you click it on a page with number 10 it will create a notification with the text "Notification 10".

fragment.
User will be able to navigate between all fragments. (create ViewPager with possibility swipe right/left)
